# DataHinge-CLI

DataHinge-CLI is a command-line interface (CLI) tool that makes it easy to gather data from many sources, manage and also process data files. I built it for myself but would like to share it with the world.

## Ideas

-   Easy-to-use CLI interface for managing data files
-   Multiple reloadable modules for common data processing tasks
-   Support for custom modules and scripts
-   Multi-threaded processing for faster performance

## Installation

Have to run manually using python3 `datahinge-cli.py`
